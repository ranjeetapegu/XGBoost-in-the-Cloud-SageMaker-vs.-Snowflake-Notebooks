# XGBoost in the Cloud: SageMaker vs. Snowflake Notebooks

This project compares Amazon SageMaker Notebooks and Snowflake Notebooks for building and running a machine learning pipeline using the XGBoost algorithm.

The goal is to help data scientists understand the trade-offs between the two platforms in terms of setup, performance, cost, and developer experience â€” all using the same binary classification use case.

## Use Case: Churn Prediction
Customer loss can significantly impact a businessâ€™s bottom line. By detecting at-risk customers early, companies can proactively engage them with retention strategies. In this workshop, we'll explore how to use Snowflakeâ€™s machine learning (ML) capabilities to automate the identification of dissatisfied customersâ€”commonly referred to as churn prediction

## Platforms Compared

### âœ… Amazon SageMaker Notebook
https://sagemaker-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction_to_applying_machine_learning/xgboost_customer_churn/xgboost_customer_churn_outputs.html#Data

- Runs on managed EC2 infrastructure
- Uses S3 for data input/output
- Supports distributed training with `sagemaker.estimator.Estimator`
- Ideal for custom training jobs and real-time inference endpoints

### âœ… Snowflake Notebook
- Fully browser-based (no setup required)
- Uses in-database compute with Snowpark ML
- Training and inference happen inside Snowflake (no data movement)
- Easy integration with Snowflake ML Registry & Cortex LLMs
